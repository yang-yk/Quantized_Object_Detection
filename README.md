### This is a demo for object detection using 8-bit quantization network without BN (Batch Normlization). The size of input image is 128*128. Please download the data from 'https://cloud.tsinghua.edu.cn/d/fa8c734b3ab043d49df5/'.  


#### For network training: python3 main_ann.py

#### For weight saving: python3 saveweight.py

#### For feature saving: python3 savefeature.py

#### For video showing: python3 Quan_Result_video_show.py

#### For video writing: python3 Quan_Result_video_write.py

### The detection results are as shown in the video *.avi. The weights and features of the network are saved in the directory ./data. And the Detection results of the test set are saved in the path ./result.
